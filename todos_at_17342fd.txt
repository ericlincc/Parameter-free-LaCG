What changed:
  - Renamed a few classes, functions and variables to match Python PEP8 standards.
  - Reused quadratic in argmin_quadratic_over_active_set()
  - Remove one linear oracle call per iter in PFLaCG() in the FAFW algorithm, which now returns the wolfe gap and the strong wolfe gap.
  - Add back the smoothness inequality checking (eta condition) to take advantage of the stability for quadratics.

--------------------

(Imminent) TODOs:
  - Verify that we can use fw_variant="PFW" in PFLaCG()
  - Verify that experiment_driver.py is working with PFLaCG
  - Update the README.md to include basic instructions

--------------------

Side notes:
  - Can use the command "py3clean ." when at the root of repo to clear all python cache

--------------------

(Can be defered) TODOs:

pflacg.py
  - Add descriptions in ParameterFreeLaCG and FractionalAwayStepFW()

project_onto_active_set_jit.py
  - Add description in accelerated_projected_gradient_descent_over_simplex_jit()
  - Not a TODO but these parameters may need tunings: 1e-15 and 1e-11 in line 140

_algorithms_utils.py
  - Add description in argmin_quadratic_over_active_set()
  - Can we remove smoothnessEstimate()?
  - Need both max_min_vertices()?
  - We are not using delete_vertex_index() in fw_variants.py. Remove or keep it for now?
  - We are not using new_vertex_fail_fast() in fw_variants.py. Remove or keep it for now?
  - We are not using backtracking_step_size() in fw_variants.py. Remove it or keep it for now?

fw_variants.py
  - A lot of function/class descriptions are missing or not up-to-date.

objective_functions.py
  - Add description in random_psd_generator_sparse()
  - Add descriptions in LogisticRegression() and GraphicalLasso()

feasible_regions.py
  - Add description in Spectrahedron()
  - Move helpers for FlowPolytope() to the top or into experiment_helper.py
